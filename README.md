predicting housing problems using R language

The problem we are working on is predicting housing prices based on some parameters, and the train data that we must use to train our model.
Then we need to test the test data with our model and try to predict the prices .
The lesser the MSE the better the model.I break this project into different parts and explain each one sepertly.
